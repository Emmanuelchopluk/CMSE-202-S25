    "Pandas is pretty flexible about reading in data and can read in a [variety of formats](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html).

    "A toy dataset is often one that has a particularly nice set of features or is of a manageable size such that it can be used as a good dataset for learning new data analysis techiques or testing out code. This allows one to focus on the code and data science methods without getting too caught up in wrangling the data. However, **data wrangling** is an authentic part of doing any sort of meaningful data analysis as data more often messier than not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although you will be working with a toy dataset today, you may still have to do a bit of wrangling along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Getting used to looking for useful information on the internet\n",
    "\n",
    "Another authentic part of working as a computational professional is getting comfortable with searching for help on the internet when you get stuck or run into something that is unfamiliar to you. The Python data analysis/computional modeling world can be complicated and is ever-evolving. There is also a large number of publicly available toolsets with varying levels of complexity and nuance. Through practice and experience, we become better computational folks by learning how to search for better, more efficient, clearer ways to do things. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Iris data\n",
    "\n",
    "The iris data set is pretty straight forward (review the wikipedia link above if you haven't yet), especially if someone has done all of the data wrangling and cleaning for you. To make it a little more interesting we provide it in a raw form that you might encounter with other data.\n",
